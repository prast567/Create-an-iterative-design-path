Iterative Design & The Future of Flyber: A Path Forward
In the past 6 months, our team worked tirelessly to launch the first flying car app, Flyber, to customers across New York City. The app has been something of a steep hit with the core group of flyers you launched with.

In this project I have layed out a plan for how to identify paths forward which will give us the best chance at success. For this I pitched the team on an iterative design process that brings qualitative and quantitative techniques together in order to minimize industry-standard risk types so that we can move forward confidently.
